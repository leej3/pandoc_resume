Education
---------

**PhD, Neuroscience:** 2015, Trinity College, University of Dublin (TCD)
 <!--    Thesis title: Olfactory Habituation in *Drosophila melanogaster* -->

**Data Science Specialization:** 2015, Johns Hopkins University - Coursera

**Diploma, Statistics:** 2015, TCD

**BAmod, Natural Science - Neuroscience:** 2009, TCD

Skills
---
**Programming** I program daily with R, Python, and Bash, focusing predominantly on data wrangling and assembling/modifying reproducible-pipelines using pre-existing algorithms/software suites and contributing to several open-source libraries on Github, including some outside the domain of human-neuroimaging.

**Testing and packaging software**
I work with continuous-integration tools (Travis, Circleci),
testing infrastructures (Nose, Pytest, Ctest), and software packaging (Pip, Conda, Cpack).

**Distributed computation**
Predominantly in the context of human neuroimaging software, I leverage compute-cluster resources through several front-ends (Dask, Ippyparallel, Swarm, Slurm, Nipype) and work in AWS cloud-computing.

**Containers**
I am an expert in using and defining software environments with container technologies (Docker and Singularity).

**Automation**
I automate workflows using tools like Crontab, Bash, and Python to improve the efficiency, reproducibility, and scalability of my work.

**System administration**
Along with a team, I maintain GPU-compute servers (Ubuntu OS) as part of the work at the NIH.

**Best practice**
I have been involved in several workshops on best practices for scientific computing and software development (in the role of teacher, helper, or curriculum developer).
<!-- **Collaboration:** Whenever I generate a solution to a problem, I seek to build off what already exists.
 To do so, I collaborate with people on-site and others across other academic institutions who work in my domain.
  I continually work to develop the requisite skills in tooling and communication to become more effective at collaborative problem solving strategies.
 -->
<!-- **Relational databases:** I have limited experience with SQL from teaching courses in Software Carpentry and from using SQLAlchemy to interface to a pre-existing database. -->

<!-- **Medicare and insurance claims data:** When working at Virginia Hospital Center, I worked with some records of CPT codes. My experience with this was limited to a couple of months though. -->

Experience
---
**Dev Ops Engineer:** 2018-Present, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland

+ As a member of the science and statistical computing core, I developed a new build system for the team, using CMake for cross-platform compatibility and reducing maintenance effort.
+ By packaging our code with standard tools, I created a more efficient distribution of releases to our users.
+ I designed a continuous integration system that greatly reduces developer burden and is built upon widely-used Python tools for testing, data versioning, and neuroimaging analysis.

**Python Instructor:** 2019-2020, Foundation for Advanced Education in the Sciences

+ I taught a 14-week course, "Introduction to Python" (Biof-309), during fall and spring semester.

**Data Scientist:** 2016-2018, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland

+ As a member of the data science and sharing team, I built pipelines for processing magnetic resonance imaging data of human brains, using Python and R.
+ By introducing software container technologies to our team, I eased our ability to work reproducibly in different compute contexts, including the NIH compute cluster.

**Data Analyst Intern:** 2016, Virginia Hospital Center, Arlington, Virginia

+ I compiled an annual report detailing every insurance payment request and employee salary in the hospital.

**Doctoral Candidate:** 2010-2015, Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, Dublin, Ireland

+ I studied a simple olfactory behavior in the fruit fly to develop a better understanding of the molecular and cellular underpinnings in learning and memory.
+ I automated an experimental setup by way of bespoke electronic components, interfaces to high end research components, programmable logic controllers, an Arduino microcontroller, and electrical systems of my own design.
+ I developed software tools in Matlab to analyze data describing neural activity in efficient manner.

**Research Assistant:** 2010, Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, Dublin, Ireland

+ I established molecular techniques for assessing NFÎºB activity in a model for delirium and neurodegeneration in mice.

**Research Assistant:** 2009, National Center for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, India

+  I wrote image-processing scripts in Matlab to categorize and quantify bacterial colonies according to size, color, and distance from biochemical signaling sources.
