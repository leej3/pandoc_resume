Skills
---
**General data analysis:** Applied statistics, including experimental design and hypothesis testing. Expert in Matlab, R, and Python programming languages.

**Human neuroimaging:** Have recently worked with a range of human MRI datasets for the purposes of quality control and standardization for sharing and subsequent analysis.

**Software development:** Proficiency in git, github, continuous integration, and containerization

**Presentation:** Strong communication skills. Comfortable speaking publicly and conveying concepts to people at any level of expertise. Regularly use software tools for reporting analyses and literate programming/computation including LaTeX, Markdown, R-Markdown, and Jupyter notebooks.

**Knowledge of biology:** A broad knowledge of biology with more detailed knowledge of molecular/cellular biology and neural physiology/dysfunction.

Experience
---
+ **Data scientist working with Dr. Adam Thomas, NIMH**

I have been using established tools for data processing in human neuroimaging to create shareable, quality controlled datasets from researchers at the intramural program at NIMH.

+ **Doctoral studies working with Professor Mani Ramaswami, TCD**

I studied a simple olfactory behavior in the fruit fly in order to better understand the molecular and cellular underpinnings of learning and memory. 
To this end, I established dissection methods for *in vivo* characterization of changes in neural activity during the learning behavior, used both calcium-imaging and electrophysiological techniques to record from olfactory neurons, and developed software tools in Matlab to make analysis of the resulting data both easy and efficient.

+ **Research assistant working with Dr. Colm Cunningham (Jan-Jul 2010), TCD**

I established molecular techniques for assessing NFκB activity in a model for delirium and neurodegeneration in mice.

+ **Research assistant working with Dr. Mukund Thattai (Summer, 2009), NCBS (Bangalore, India)**

I developed a high throughput assay for biochemical signaling between cultured bacterial colonies.
I also wrote image-processing scripts in Matlab to categorize and quantify bacterial colonies according to size, color, and distance from biochemical signaling sources.
