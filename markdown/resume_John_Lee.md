Skills
---

**Programming and data analysis:** In addition to years of Matlab programming, I have been programming daily for 3 years with R or Python, as well as some necessary use of bash . My experience has been predominantly with data wrangling and assembling reproducible-pipelines with pre-existing algorithms/software suites.

**Collaboration:** Whenever I generate a solution to a problem, I seek to build off what already exists. To do so, I collaborate with people on-site and others across other academic institutions who work in my domain. I continually work to develop the requisite skills in tooling and communication to become more effective at collaborative problem solving strategies.

**Relational databases:** I have limited experience with SQL from teaching courses in Software Carpentry and from using SQLAlchemy to interface to a pre-existing database.

**Medicare and insurance claims data:** When working at Virginia Hospital Center, I worked with some records of CPT codes. My experience with this was limited to a couple of months though.


Experience
---
2016-Present
:   **Data Scientist,** National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland

+ Worked as a member of Adam Thomas's Data Science and Sharing Team.
