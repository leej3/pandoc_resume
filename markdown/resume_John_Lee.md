<!-- 
Skills
---

**Programming** In addition to several years of Matlab programming, I have been programming daily for 3 years with R, Python, and Bash.
This more recent experience has been predominantly with data wrangling and assembling/modifying reproducible-pipelines using pre-existing algorithms/software suites 
but I have also contributed extensively to several open-source libraries on github, including some outside the domain of human-neuroimaging.

**Testing and packaging software**
I have some experience with continuous-integration tools (travis, circleci),
testing infrastructures (nose, pytest, ctest), and software packaging (pip, conda, cpack).

**Distributed computation**
Predominantly in the context of human neuroimaging software I have leveraged compute-cluster resources through several front-ends (dask, ippyparallel, swarm, slurm, nipype) and have some experience with AWS cloud-computing.

**Containers**
I am expert in using and defining software environments with container technologies (docker and singularity).

**Automation**
On a daily basis I automate workflows using tools like crontab, bash, and python to improve the efficiency, reproducibility, and scalability of several aspects of my role.

**System administration**
I am part of a team that maintains GPU-compute servers as part of the work at the NIH. This administrative experience is limited to the Ubuntu operating system.

**Best practice**
I have been involved in several workshops on best practices for scientific computing and software development (in the role of teacher, helper, or curriculum developer). -->



<!-- **Collaboration:** Whenever I generate a solution to a problem, I seek to build off what already exists.
 To do so, I collaborate with people on-site and others across other academic institutions who work in my domain.
  I continually work to develop the requisite skills in tooling and communication to become more effective at collaborative problem solving strategies.
 -->
<!-- **Relational databases:** I have limited experience with SQL from teaching courses in Software Carpentry and from using SQLAlchemy to interface to a pre-existing database. -->

<!-- **Medicare and insurance claims data:** When working at Virginia Hospital Center, I worked with some records of CPT codes. My experience with this was limited to a couple of months though. -->


Experience
---

2018-Present
:   **Dev Ops Engineer,** National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland

+ I worked as a member of Dr. Bob Cox's Science and statistical computing core.
+ I developed a new build system for the team using CMake for cross-platform compatibility and reducing maintenance effort.
+ I packaged the code using standard packaging tools for easier distribution of releases to our users.
+ I created a continuous integration system that greatly reduces developer burden and is built upon widely used Python tools for testing, data versioning, and neuroimaging analysis.

2019-2020
:   **Python Instructor,** Foundation for Advanced Education in the Sciences

+ 14-week course "Introduction to Python" (Biof-309)

2016-2018
:   **Data Scientist,** National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland

+ I worked as a member of Dr. Adam Thomas's Data Science and Sharing Team.
+ I used Python and R to build pipelines for processing magnetic resonance imaging data of human brains.
+ Through my use of software container technologies, I worked reproducibly in different compute contexts, including the NIH compute cluster.

2016
: **Data Analyst Intern,** Virginia Hospital Center, Arlington, Virginia

+ I compiled an annual report detailing every insurance payment request and employee salary in the hospital.

2010-2015
:  **Doctoral Candidate,** Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, Dublin, Ireland

+ I worked with Prof. Mani Ramaswami, studying a simple olfactory behavior in the fruit fly to develop a better understanding of the molecular and cellular underpinnings in learning and memory.
+ I developed software tools in Matlab to analyze data describing neural activity in an easy and efficient manner.


2010
:  **Research Assistant,** Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, Dublin, Ireland

+ Worked with Prof. Colm Cunningham to establish molecular techniques for assessing NFÎºB activity in a model for delirium and neurodegeneration in mice.

2009
: **Research Assistant,** National Center for Biological Sciences (Bangalore, India)

+  Wrote image-processing scripts in Matlab to categorize and quantify bacterial colonies according to size, color, and distance from biochemical signaling sources.
