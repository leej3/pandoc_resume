<!--
Add restful apis to technologies
-->
Starting my career with a PhD in neuroscience, I have worked in data science and software engineering over the last five years. I program daily using Python and Bash.
I  have worked extensively in R and Matlab and occasionally write C.
<!--
Initially focusing mostly on data wrangling and assembling/modifying reproducible-pipelines using pre-existing algorithms/software suites, I have more recently been developing software more formally.
-->
I have contributed to several open-source libraries.

Skills
---

**CI sytems:**
I have broad experience with continuous integration testing systems helping keep my code maintainable and robust.
I created a generic infrastructure for convenient execution  of a language agnostic test suite, which included protecting against (and debugging) race conditions for robust parallel execution, efficient test data management, and headless GUI execution.
<!--
While I have predominantly worked with CircleCI, I have experience with TravisCI, Jenkins, GitlabCI, and TestKraken (to which I have contributed).
-->

**Data munging:**
I have performed data processing at scale, distilling insights into graphics and statistical models using data science tools (in Python).

**Build tools:**
I have worked extensively with a large complex build system.
The software suite was developed over ~25 years, comprised of >600 programs, ~1.5 million lines of code, several previously unpackaged dependencies.
<!--
In addition to modifying the pre-existing Makefile build, I completed pre-existing efforts to port the build to CMake in which I have substantial expertise.
The build now works efficiently across Unix like systems with various compilers and linkers satisfying all target systems of my team.
-->

**git:**
I have used git version control for over a decade.
I work regularly with aspects of commit management (bisect, interactive rebase, patch application, etc.).
I have also worked with more advanced aspects of git such as grafting histories and rewriting histories with deletion of large binaries.

**Computing at scale:**
Predominantly in the context of human neuroimaging software, I leverage compute-cluster resources using community tools (Dask, ipyparallel, Swarm, Slurm, Nipype), sometimes efficiently using thousands of CPU hours within a day on one of the largest supercomputers in the world.

**Cloud architectures:**
Typically using awscli (but also a little Ansible), I have set up and used cloud computing and data storage (EC2 and S3).

**Containers:**
I frequently use containerization (including Docker and Singularity) for defining reproducible, version-able, and portable software environments.

**Packaging software:**
I have substantial experience with using packaging tools including pip, conda, CPack, and Debian tools.

**Automation/Orchestration:**
I automate workflows, using tools like Python, Bash, git, Circleci, Docker, and Cron to improve the efficiency, reproducibility, and scalability of my work.

**Machine Learning:**
I have built machine learning pipelines using scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

<!--
**Linux:**
I spend my days using Linux. This ranges from servers, clusters, cloud, and containers to my personal laptop and mobile phone (mobian on PinePhone).
-->

**Best practice:**
I have been involved in several workshops on best practices for scientific computing and software development (in the role of teacher, helper, or curriculum developer).

**Collaboration:**
Whenever I'm solving a problem, I seek to build off what already exists.
Python and git excel as tools for this community driven approach.

**Relational databases:** I have experience with SQL from teaching courses in Software Carpentry and from using SQLAlchemy to connect to pre-existing databases.

<!--
**Medicare and insurance claims data:** When working at Virginia Hospital Center, I worked with some records of CPT codes. My experience with this was limited to a couple of months though.

**System administration:**
+Along with a team, I maintain GPU-compute servers (Ubuntu OS) as part of the work at the NIH.
-->

Experience
---
**Dev Ops Engineer:** 2018-Present, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland

+ NIMH, with a budget of $1.5 billion, is the largest research organization specializing in mental illness in the world.
<!--
+ As a member of the science and statistical computing core, I developed a new build system for the team, using CMake for cross-platform compatibility and reducing maintenance effort.
 -->
+ As a member of the science and statistical computing core, I co-opted community tools to facilitate software development on my team.
Whether this was docker for environment encapsulation or NiPype for workflow creation, I blended the group's software with work from other groups for optimal pipelines for the community.

<!--
+ By packaging our code with standard tools, I created a more efficient distribution of releases to our users.
-->
<!--
+ I designed a continuous integration system that greatly reduces developer burden and is built upon widely-used Python tools for testing, data versioning, and neuroimaging analysis.
-->

**Python Instructor:** 2019-2020, Foundation for Advanced Education in the Sciences

+ I taught a 14-week course, "Introduction to Python" (Biof-309) for two semesters.

**Data Scientist:** 2016-2018, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland

+ I uploaded several datasets collected by scientists on site to online public repositories.
This required collaboration with the scientists and attention to repository data specifications.

+ I built pipelines for processing MRI data of human brains, using Python and R.
<!--
+ By introducing software container technologies to our team, I eased our ability to work reproducibly in different compute contexts, including the NIH compute cluster.
-->

**Data Analyst Intern:** 2016, Virginia Hospital Center, Arlington, Virginia

+ I compiled an annual report detailing every insurance payment request and employee salary in the hospital.

**Doctoral Candidate:** 2010-2015, Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, Dublin, Ireland

+ I elucidated neural network changes for a simple olfactory behavior.
<!--
+ I automated an experimental setup by way of bespoke electronic components, interfaces to high end research components, programmable logic controllers, an Arduino micro-controller, and electrical systems of my own design
-->
+ I worked with molecular assay technologies (for proteins and nucleotides) with some use of sequence analysis tools.
+ I developed software tools to analyze the data I collected. These tools performed data wrangling, DSP, image processing, plotting, and statistics.

**Research Assistant:** 2010, Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, Dublin, Ireland

+ I established molecular techniques for assessing NFÎºB activity in a model for delirium and neurodegeneration in mice.

**Research Assistant:** 2009, National Center for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, India

+  I wrote image-processing scripts in Matlab to automate the categorization/quantification of bacterial colonies according to size, color, and distance from biochemical signaling sources.
